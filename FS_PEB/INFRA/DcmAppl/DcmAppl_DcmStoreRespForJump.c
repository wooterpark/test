 * This API is invoked for Storing of Response information when user specific service is used for Jumping to Boot.\n
 * This API should fill in SID|0x40 and response bytes for response. Dcm will only pass the structure
 * for the user to update. It is the responsibility of the user to fill in the correct data.\n
 *     1. Fill ProgConditions->SubFncId     with Subfunc\n
 *     2. Fill ProgConditions->SID          with SID\n
 *     3. Fill ProgConditions.ReqResBuf[0]  with response bytes\n
 *     4. Fill ProgConditions->ReqResLen    with response length\n
 *
 *  Ex:  Response-> Fill SID|0x40, Subfunc, Request Bytes if any\n
 * Response Len needs to be filled. Response length also includes SID and Subfunc.\n
 * If the service has only SID then Response length is 1 byte.\n
 * If the service has only response SID and subfunction in response then Response length is 2 bytes etc.\n
 *
 * Note: This API will be called for every Jump To Boot transition. User needs to modify this API
 * only if User specific service is used for Jump to Boot.\n
 *
 * @param[inout]         ProgConditions : structure for the user to update.
