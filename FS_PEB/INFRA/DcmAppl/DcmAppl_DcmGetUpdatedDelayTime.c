 * DcmAppl_DcmGetUpdatedDelayTime :-\n
 *  Request to application to provide the updated delay time in milliseconds.\n
 *  More Information :-When the delay count is exceeded the delay timer should be started for the corresponding security level.
 *  If the delay count is exceeded this API is called with input parameter DelayTime (configured in SECA configuration) so that the application can change the
 *  Delay time if needed, depending on the number of times delay timer is activated.\n
 *  Ex: Delay Timer value for Security level 0x01 is 100ms, Delay count configured is 0x03.
 *  If Number of attempts performed to unlock security level is 3 the delay timer should be started.
 *  Call the API DcmAppl_DcmGetUpdatedDelayTime(Delay Time) which can change the delay time value and returns the updated delay time (Delay Time * n) where n = 1,2,3 etc.
 *  This API will return the same value sent to this function if the time is not changed by user.
 *
 * @param[in]           SecurityLevel      :  Security level for which the updated delay count is requested.
 * @param[in]           Delaycount         :  Number of times delay timer is activated
 * @param[in]           DelayTime          :  Delay time (ms) introduced after failed access attempts
 * @param[out]          None
 * @retval              Updated Delay time or power on delay time in milliseconds
