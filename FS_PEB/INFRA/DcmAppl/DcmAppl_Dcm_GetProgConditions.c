 * This API is used for restoring the Programming Information by the application.\n
 * This API should  restore the Programming conditions from the Non volatile memory which was stored during Jump To Boot.\n
 * In this API user has to restore the protocol information required to start Dcm\n
 *
 *  @param[in] ProgConditions \n
 *  The following information needs to be filled by the user in ProgConditions\n
 *     1. ProtocolID - protocol which needs to be started as default\n
 *     2. Tester Source address - Connection will be derived from this input\n
 *     3. SID - service identifier (In case of Warm request/Warm response)\n
 *     4. SubFncId - Subfunction ID\n
 *     5. StoreType - Storage Type used for restoring, Warm Request/Warm Response/Warm Init\n
 *     6. SessionLevel - Session level which needs to be started\n
 *     7. SecurityLevel - Security level which needs to be started\n
 *     8. ReqResLen - Total request/response length including SID and Subfunc\n
 *     9. Request/Response bytes which follows the SID and Subfunc\n
 *     10.Number of Response pending 0x78 triggered before the jump\n
 *     11.Elapsed time in Drive or Boot\n
 *     12. NumOfSecurityLevels - Number of security levels configured,
 *           If the configuration parameter DcmDspSecurityStoreDelayCountAndTimerOnJump  is set to True, then the below information has to be stored
 *     13. SecurityInformation[].SecurityLevel = Security level\n
 *     14.SecurityInformation[].DelayCount = The failed attempt count per SecurityLevel\n
 *     15.SecurityInformation[].ResidualDelay = Remaining delay (either remaining powerOndelay/remaining delay time) per SecurityLevel which will be started in Dcm per security level\n
 *     16.freeForProjectUse 6 bytes of free space is provided for projects to store additional information like CAN ID, BAUD Rate, etc..\n
 *
 * @param[out]      ProgConditions : Pointer to the location where the programming conditions  to be stored.
 *
 *
 * @retval                 DCM_WARM_START : The ECU starts from a bootloader jump\n
 * @retval                 DCM_COLD_START : Start ECU Normally\n
